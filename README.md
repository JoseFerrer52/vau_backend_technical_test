# listuser-api

listuser-api is a mini API created for a technical test. This API has been developed as part of the repository vau_backend_technical_test.

The main purpose of listuser-api is to provide an efficient and easy way to manage and list users through REST endpoints. Below are some key features of this API:

1. User Creation: Allows adding new users with the necessary basic information.
2. User Listing: Provides a complete list of all registered users.
3. User Update: Facilitates the updating of existing user information.
4. User Deletion: Allows deleting users from the list of records.

This API is built using TypeScript along with Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL. The API's architecture follows a hexagonal approach, ensuring the code is clean, maintainable, and easy to extend. To securely manage user requests, an authentication layer using JWT (JSON Web Token) is implemented.
